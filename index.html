      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I attended my local community college for nearly two years before I realized that was not what I wanted to do </p>
      <p>I had always loved doing things with computers and coding and decided to take the step of starting a coding bootcamp. I am loving it so far and am committed to doing my best and pursing a career in software development.</p>
      <p>Outside of school, I work part time as a server and love the interactions I have with my customers. I also love to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Run</li>
        <li>Cycle</li>
        <li>Spend time with significant others</li>
      </ul>
